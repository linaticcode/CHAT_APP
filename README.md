Real-time Chat Application with Django and AJAX

This is a real-time chat application built using Django and AJAX. Users can enter a room name and username to join an existing chat room or create a new one. The app uses AJAX to update the chat room content periodically, allowing users to see new messages as they are sent.

A standard external database POSTGRESQL is used for this project.
